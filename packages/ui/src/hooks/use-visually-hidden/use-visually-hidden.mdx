# useVisuallyHidden

The hook `useVisuallyHidden` should only be used if you need to hide visually some contents without adding a wrapper around these contents. It can be useful for skip links for example. Otherwise, you should use the [`<VisuallyHidden />` component](/docs/components-atoms-typography-visually-hidden--docs) instead.

## Demo

The container below is visually hidden and it remains hidden even if a link was present.

<Canvas of={UseVisuallyHiddenStories.VisuallyHidden} />

When a container contains a link, you should use its `isFocusable` argument to make the focused link visible.

<Canvas of={UseVisuallyHiddenStories.Focusable} />
