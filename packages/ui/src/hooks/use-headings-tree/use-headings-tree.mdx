# useHeadingsTree

`useHeadingsTree` is a React hook that lets you retrieve all headings in a page or in the given wrapper.

## Options

The hook accepts three options:

- `fromLevel`: look for headings starting from the given level,
- `toLevel`: look for headings until the given level (included),
- `wrapper`: the element where to look for heading elements.

Without options, the hook will return all the headings in the page.

## Demo

**Tips:** use the `showOnlyHeadingsInDemo` control to see the difference with and without the wrapper option.
