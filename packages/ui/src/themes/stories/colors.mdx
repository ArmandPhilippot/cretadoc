# Colors

You can define your theme colors using design tokens. They are divided in four categories:

- background
- borders
- foreground
- primary

These categories use a semantic palette to help you identify the intended usage.

## Background

Background design tokens define the colors used as background in Cretadoc interfaces.

## Borders

Borders design tokens define the color of the borders used in Cretadoc interfaces.

<Story of={ColorsStories.Border} />

## Foreground

Foreground tokens are used to define text and icon colors. Most of them are used on a regular background:

<Story of={ColorsStories.Foreground} />

We also provide special tokens when foreground is used on a non-regular background: each token starts with `on` keyword.

<Story of={ColorsStories.ForegroundOnBackground} />

## Primary

Primary tokens define the colors used to highligh calls to action for example. They can be used as foreground color, background color and eventually as border color. The primary color is usually your brand primary color.
