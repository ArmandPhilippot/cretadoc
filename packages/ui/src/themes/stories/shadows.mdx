# Shadows

A shadow can be decomposed as follow:

- a color,
- a direction,
- an elevation.

## Color

The shadow's color should be adapted to the element's color to create harmonious interfaces.

The following colors associations are valid:

<Story of={ShadowsStories.Color} />

## Direction

Depending on the element position, the "light" orientation is not always the same. So, Cretadoc provides six different keys to define the shadow position.

<Story of={ShadowsStories.Direction} />

## Elevation

To create contrast, shadows should not have the same elevation. So, Cretadoc provides three different tokens to illustrate the difference.

<Story of={ShadowsStories.Elevation} />
