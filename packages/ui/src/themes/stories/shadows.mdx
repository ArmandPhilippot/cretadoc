# Shadows

A shadow can be decomposed as follow:

- a color,
- a direction,
- an elevation.

## Color

The shadow's color should be adapted to the element's color to create harmonious interfaces.

<Story of={ShadowsStories.Color} />

## Direction

Depending on the element position, the "light" orientation is not always the same. So, Cretadoc provides six different keys to define the shadow position.

<Story of={ShadowsStories.Direction} />

## Elevation

To create contrast, shadows should not have the same elevation. So, Cretadoc provides three different tokens to illustrate the difference.

First an example without shadow so you can compare with the tokens applied:

<Story of={ShadowsStories.WithoutShadow} />

<Story of={ShadowsStories.Elevation} />
