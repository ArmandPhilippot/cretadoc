# Icons

Cretadoc does not provide a way for theme authors to control the icons used inside the interfaces. However, you can adjust their size.

## Size

<Story of={IconsStories.Size} />

## Color

Color design tokens are defined separately: we use the same colors as the foreground. You can learn more on [Colors](/docs/themes-tokens-colors--docs) page.
