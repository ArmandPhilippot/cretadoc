# Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs are used to indicate the current location in a website and help users to understand the content hierarchy.

<Primary />

## Items separator

By default, the component uses a slash (`/`) as separator but you can choose a different character if needed.

<Canvas of={BreadcrumbsStories.TextSeparator} />

## Hide the last item

For design purposes and to avoid repeating the current page twice, you could hide the last item visually. You should use this variant only if the page title is directly under the breadcrumbs since the last separator will remain.

<Canvas of={BreadcrumbsStories.LastItemHidden} />

## Ellipsis

An ellipsis will be shown if the number of items is greater than the maximum number of items allowed. You can control the number of items visible with the `maxItems` property.

<Canvas of={BreadcrumbsStories.Ellipsis} />

## Accessibility

Since breadcrumbs provide a navigation, you should add a meaningful label (such as "_Breadcrumbs_") using the `aria-label` attribute to describe the type of navigation provided in the nav element.

You should also define the `ellipsisLabel` property used by the ellipsis button when the items are collapsed. By default its value is "_Show more items_".
