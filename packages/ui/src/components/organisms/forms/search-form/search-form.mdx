# Search Form

A search form is used to perform a research across the website contents.

<Primary />

## Layout

A search form can have different layout depending on its position in your design.

### Column

<Canvas of={SearchFormStories.LayoutColumn} />

### Row

<Canvas of={SearchFormStories.LayoutRow} />

### Spacing

If needed, you can opt out from the spacing between the labelled field and the button. It can be useful if you choose to use a custom button.

<Canvas of={SearchFormStories.WithoutSpacing} />

## Contents

You are free to decide the kind of button or label you want in your search form.

### Button

For example, you could use an icon instead of a text:

<Canvas of={SearchFormStories.IconAsButton} />

### Label

You could use a visually hidden label if it fits better in your design:

<Canvas of={SearchFormStories.VisuallyHiddenLabel} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={SearchFormStories} />
