# Card

A card is commonly used to present short content about a single subject.

<Primary />

## Contents

A card always has a [`<Heading />`](/docs/components-atoms-typography-heading--docs). In addition, it can be composed with the following elements:

- a cover (by using an [`<Img />`](/docs/components-atoms-image--docs) component),
- an excerpt,
- one or more actions (by using either a [`<Link />`](/docs/components-atoms-link--docs) component or one of the [buttons components](http://localhost:6006/?path=/docs/components-atoms-buttons--docs)).
