# Drawer

The `<Drawer />` component is a collapsible container that anchors to the left of the screen. It should be associated to a button that controls its state.

<Primary />

## Closing

You can add a close button to the bottom of the drawer. It can be useful if the opening button is hidden by the drawer or an overlay and cannot serve as a toggle button.
