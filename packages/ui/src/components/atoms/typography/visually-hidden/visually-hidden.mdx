# Visually Hidden

A `VisuallyHidden` component is commonly used for accessibility. It allows you to include some contents in your page without making them visible.

<Primary />

## Focusable

Depending on what you want to hide, sometimes the content should be focusable. It is for example useful with "skip" links.

<Canvas of={VisuallyHiddenStories.NotFocusable} />
<Canvas of={VisuallyHiddenStories.Focusable} />
<Canvas of={VisuallyHiddenStories.DeepFocusable} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={VisuallyHiddenStories} />
