# Button

A button is used to trigger an event on click.

<Primary />

## Types

A button can have three different types:

- `submit`: it indicates the button is used to submit a form
- `reset`: it indicates the button is used to reset a form
- `button`: all other cases, it is the default type

## Kind

The button appearance can change depending on its kind.

### Primary

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Primary} />

### Secondary (default)

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Secondary} />

### Neutral

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Neutral} />

## States

It can either be enabled, be disabled or indicate a loading state.

### Enabled (default)

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Enabled} />

### Disabled

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Disabled} />

### Loading

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Loading} />

## Accessibility

If the button is a toggle button, it should use the `aria-pressed` attribute to indicate the current state.

If the button controls the visibility of some other elements, it should use the `aria-expanded` attribute to indicate the current state.

Sometimes, the button body is not enough explicit for screen reader users. In that case, you should use the `aria-label` attribute to give a better indication about the button purpose.
