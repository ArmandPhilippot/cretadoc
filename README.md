# Cretadoc

Easily build and maintain your documentation using Markdown.

**WARNING: This project is no longer maintained. It was an attempt to create an easy-way for non-developers to create their own documentation. Pre-built components, simple theming... My primary goal was to experiment with Express, GraphQL API and Vanilla Extract.**
